# bakuretsu

## How to set it up
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.16.1/node-v14.16.1-x64.msi) and [MongoDB](https://fastdl.mongodb.org/windows/mongodb-windows-x86_64-4.4.5-signed.msi)
2. Check that it worked by going on Git Bash and running `node --version` and `npm --version`
   * npm is going to using an older version so update it by running `npm install npm@latest -g`
3. Clone this repository to your machine
4. Go to /bakuretsu/bakuretsu (the same level as package.json) and run `npm install`
5. Try running `npm start` and go on localhost:3000 on browser
